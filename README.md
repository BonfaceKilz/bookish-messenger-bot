# Introduction
This is a facebook messenger I created for the Nairobi Techweek that happned on 24-Mar-2017. Well, it never got presented. First things first, apologies to my teammates, I went MIA on my teammates. Anything beyond this would make this sound like a lame excuse.

With that said, I had problems configuring heroku with my app. Me being me, I spent 5 hours trying to figure out why stuff was not working. Ended being an issue with port numbers. Anyway, I'm now using ngrok to test the app locally.

# Goals
My original aim for this bot was to be able to connect to XDC bots and download books. I figure this is illegal in some places. I've tweaked my goals to make this bot able to be able to fetch useful data from goodreads.

# Todo
1. Look for better APIs to use. Use them in app.
2. Write HowToUse[basics] instructions
3. Write HowToSetUp instructions
4. ~~Write Features List~~

# How To Set Up
To test the bot, I recommend to set it up using `ngrok`.
